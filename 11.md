## How Pernicious and Clandestine Are North American Operatives and Agents?

In weapons design, increase in either the reach, speed, stealth, or lethality of weaponry and armaments, reduces the effectiveness as well as the time-frame the target entity can avail, in being able to evade or respond to incoming attacks. 

The main form and structure of pernicious attacks being directed at vulnerable individuals and groups, within as well as outside Canadian territories, from North America, involves strategies and tactics with several policy based methods and institutional resources being put to effect, which collectively produce slightly reduced lethality and speed of a weaponized system or instrument, while increasing its reach and stealthiness, for inflicting visceral or socio-economic harms upon profiled and, targeted persons. Such attacks are primarily conducted via "compartmentalized" government sponsored public service units and their private contractors. Those types of clandestine and coordinated, multi-pronged attacks, invariably take the form of sabotage, subversion, marginalization, harassment, debilitation, sterilization, and systematic serial murders of ethnic minorities, Muslims, people with disabilities, dissidents, misfits, and 'unwanted' newcomers. 

Such cunning attacks borne out of xenophobia and prejudices, involve the use of apparent compartmentalization of staff and personnel, across several government-regulated agencies and private organization via proxy based communication techniques for collusion, to gain a defense via the concept of "plausible deniability" against any legal actions. This type of an overall syndication is used by those organized operatives so that, when any of the units among the set of coordinated inter-agency perpetrators are caught red-handed, in the act of doing willful harm to targeted individuals and groups, other corrupt units at "an arm's distance" from the recognizably felonious ones, remain hidden and indemnified. The judiciary in Canada, till date, has conveniently protected state-sponsored bad actors such as those who were implicated in the rapes and murders of indigenous children in residential schools and hospitals, by giving those perpetrators indemnity, immunity, and basically a free pass, to carry on their grievous and nefarious deeds, without any serious legal repercussions. Stalling investigations of, downplaying the damages produced by, and then covering up those types of heinous crimes and violations, while denying justice to victims and survivors of human-rights abuses, has become a long-standing tradition, in Canada. 

Responding to that type of pernicious and clandestine insidiousness, with aggression or violence of action, only allows those cunning state-sponsored perpetrators to feign injury and indignation, while pretending to be innocent and dutiful.  

>So what needs to be done, to protect innocent civilians, and to obtain proper justice for victims and survivors of Canada's state-sponsored violations? 

Comprehending the form and structure of how those rampant violations are still being committed by trained and instructed members of Canada's institutions, would be a start towards building enforceable solutions for arresting and permanently ending the reign of those state-sponsored violators, and to dismantle the overall apparatus including its funding mechanisms, that are being used for perpetrating such wretched and woeful wrongdoings.
